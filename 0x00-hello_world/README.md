C Programming Practice Project
This repository contains a collection of tasks aimed at practicing C programming skills. Each task involves creating scripts or programs to perform specific actions, such as preprocessing C code, compiling without linking, generating assembly code, and more. The project covers fundamental concepts of C programming, such as preprocessor directives, compilation, assembly generation, and basic output using printf and puts. The tasks provide hands-on experience in working with different aspects of the C programming language.

Tasks Included
Preprocessor: Script to run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
Compiler: Script to compile a C file without linking, generating an object file.
Assembler: Script to generate assembly code from a C file and save it to an output file.
Naming: Script to compile a C file and create an executable named "cisfun".
Hello, puts: C program to print a specific text using the puts function.
Hello, printf: C program to print a text using the printf function.
Size Information: C program to print the size of various data types on the current machine.
Intel Assembly: Script to generate assembly code (Intel syntax) from a C file.
UNIX Quote: C program to print a specific quote to the standard error stream.
These tasks provide a structured way to practice and reinforce C programming concepts.
