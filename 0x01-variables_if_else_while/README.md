C Programming Practice Tasks
This section includes a series of C programming tasks aimed at practicing different concepts and techniques. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of C programming and provides example source code along with expected outputs. The tasks cover topics like conditional statements, loops, character printing, and number combinations.

Task 0: Positive or Negative
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it's executed. The source code is provided to determine whether the number stored in n is positive, negative, or zero.

Task 1: The Last Digit
Similar to the first task, this program assigns a random number to n and prints the last digit along with specific conditions based on its value.

Task 2: Printing the Alphabet
This program uses the putchar function to print the lowercase alphabet in a single line.

Task 3: AlphABET
Building upon the previous task, this program prints both lowercase and uppercase alphabets using the putchar function.

Task 4: Alphabet without 'q' and 'e'
This program prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters 'q' and 'e' using the putchar function.

Task 5: Printing Numbers
This program prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 using the putchar function.

Task 6: Printing Numbers without char
Similar to the previous task, this program prints single-digit numbers without using any variable of type char, using only the putchar function.

Task 7: Reverse Alphabet
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using the putchar function.

Task 8: Hexadecimal Numbers
This program prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase using the putchar function.

Task 9: Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces using the putchar function. No variables of type char are used.

Task 10: Combinations of Two Digits
This advanced task prints all possible combinations of two different two-digit numbers using the putchar function, following specific formatting rules.

Task 11: Combinations of Three Digits
Another advanced task that prints all possible combinations of three different digits, following specific formatting rules and using the putchar function.

Task 12: Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers
In this advanced task, the program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, following formatting rules and using the putchar function.

These tasks are designed to help you practice various programming techniques in the C language.
