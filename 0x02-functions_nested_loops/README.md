Description
In this project, we explore the basics of programming using the C language, specifically focusing on functions and nested loops. Each program is designed to cover a specific concept and build upon the knowledge gained from previous programs. From simple output functions to more complex problem-solving exercises, you'll find a variety of challenges to strengthen your programming skills.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory of the specific program you want to work on.
Each program directory contains a set of .c files, and you can use a C compiler to compile and run these programs on your machine.

List of Programs
This project includes the following programs:

_putchar: A program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
print_alphabet: Prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line.
print_alphabet_x10: Prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each followed by a new line.
_islower: Checks if a character is lowercase.
_isalpha: Checks if a character is alphabetic.
print_sign: Prints the sign of a number.
_abs: Computes the absolute value of an integer.
print_last_digit: Prints the last digit of a number.
jack_bauer: Prints every minute of the day in the format "HH:MM".
times_table: Prints the 9 times table.
add: Adds two integers and returns the result.
print_to_98: Prints natural numbers from a given number to 98.
print_times_table: Prints the n times table.
sum_of_multiples: Computes and prints the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
print_fibonacci_50: Prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
even_fibonacci_sum: Prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4,000,000.
print_fibonacci_98: Prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.
Usage
Navigate to the directory of the specific program you want to use and follow the compilation and execution instructions provided in each program's README.
