Programming
Welcome to the "Debugging Challenges in C Programming" project! This repository contains a series of C programs that serve as debugging challenges. The purpose of these challenges is to enhance your debugging skills and help you become more proficient in identifying and fixing issues in C code.

Task 3: Leap Year
Task 0: Multiple Mains
In this task, you'll be provided with a main file that tests a function positive_or_negative(). Your goal is to create a new 0-main.c file that tests the function's behavior with the input value of 0. The challenge focuses on testing, not coding the solution, and you must ensure your solution passes the test without altering the provided code except for a single line change.

Task 1: Like, Comment, Subscribe
For this task, you will work with a main file that contains an infinite loop. Your task is to comment out the problematic part of the code causing the infinite loop. The main goal here is to prevent the infinite loop while maintaining the line count, as adding or removing lines of code is not allowed.

Task 2: 0 > 972?
In this task, you're given code that's intended to find the largest of three integers. However, there's a bug causing incorrect output. Your mission is to fix the largest_number() function so that it correctly identifies and prints the largest number among the three provided integers.

Task 3: Leap Year
Task 3 involves debugging a program that converts a given date to the day of the year, accounting for leap years. The program has three files: 3-main_a.c, 3-convert_day.c, and 3-print_remaining_days.c. Your task is to ensure that the print_remaining_days() function produces the correct output for all dates and correctly considers leap years. You should fix any bugs that prevent the function from functioning as expected.

Instructions for Each Task
For each task, you'll find a set of files (main file, source files, and headers) and a description of the task's objective. Your goal is to debug the code so that it produces the expected output. Make sure to follow the instructions and constraints provided for each task. Feel free to use debugging tools, print statements, and your problem-solving skills to resolve the issues in the code.

Contributing
If you identify any errors in the challenge descriptions or find better ways to solve the issues, feel free to contribute! You can open issues for discussions or submit pull requests to suggest improvements to the code or documentation.
