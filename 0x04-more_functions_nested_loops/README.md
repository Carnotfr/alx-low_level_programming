More Functions and Nested Loops Challenges in C Programming
Welcome to the "More Functions and Nested Loops Challenges in C Programming" project! In this repository, you'll find a series of C programming challenges designed to help you improve your skills in working with functions and nested loops. Each task focuses on a specific concept and requires you to create or debug functions to accomplish the given objectives.

Task 0: isupper
This task involves writing a function _isupper() that checks if a character is uppercase. The function returns 1 if the character is uppercase and 0 otherwise. You'll also find a main file to test the function with sample inputs.

Task 1: isdigit
In this task, you'll create a function _isdigit() that checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9). The function returns 1 if the character is a digit and 0 otherwise. A main file is provided for testing.

Task 2: Collaboration is Multiplication
This task requires you to write a function mul() that multiplies two integers. The function prototype is provided, and you'll find a main file to test the function's implementation.

Task 3: The Numbers Speak for Themselves
Here, you'll implement a function print_numbers() that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use _putchar() function twice in your code.

Task 4: I Believe in Numbers and Signs
For this task, your goal is to implement a function print_most_numbers() that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4. You are allowed to use _putchar() function twice in your code.

Task 5: Numbers Constitute the Only Universal Language
In this task, you'll write a function more_numbers() that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, repeated 10 times, each followed by a new line. You are allowed to use _putchar() function three times in your code.

Task 6: The Shortest Distance Between Two Points is a Straight Line
Create a function print_line() that draws a straight line using the _putchar() function. The number of times the character _ is printed is determined by the input value n.

Task 7: I Feel Like I Am Diagonally Parked in a Parallel Universe
For this task, you'll implement a function print_diagonal() that draws a diagonal line using the _putchar() function. The number of times the character \ is printed is determined by the input value n.

Task 8: You Are So Much Sunshine in Every Square Inch
Write a function print_square() that prints a square made of # characters. The size of the square is determined by the input value size.

Task 9: Fizz-Buzz
The Fizz-Buzz test is a classic interview question. You'll write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."

Task 10: Triangles
In this task, you'll implement a function print_triangle() that prints a right-angled triangle made of # characters. The size of the triangle is determined by the input value size.

Task 11: The Problem of Distinguishing Prime Numbers
Here, you'll write a program to find and print the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.

Task 12: Numbers Have Life; They're Not Just Symbols on Paper
For this advanced task, implement a function print_number() that prints an integer using the _putchar() function. You are not allowed to use long, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded values.
