Low-Level Programming and Algorithms
Welcome to the "Low-Level Programming and Algorithms" project! In this repository, you'll find a series of C programming challenges that will help you strengthen your skills in working with pointers, strings, and various algorithms. Each task focuses on a specific concept and requires you to create functions or programs to accomplish the given objectives.

Task 0: 98 Battery St.
Description: Write a function reset_to_98 that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to, setting it to 98.

Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

Task 1: Don't Swap Horses in Crossing a Stream
Description: Create a function swap_int that swaps the values of two integers.

Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

Task 2: This Report, by Its Very Length, Defends Itself against the Risk of Being Read
Description: Write a function _strlen that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

Task 3: I Do Not Fear Computers. I Fear the Lack of Them
Description: Implement a function _puts that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

Task 4: I Can Only Go One Way. I've Not Got a Reverse Gear
Description: Write a function print_rev that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

Task 5: A Good Engineer Thinks in Reverse and Asks Himself about the Stylistic Consequences of the Components and Systems He Proposes
Description: Create a function rev_string that reverses a string.

Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

Task 6: Half the Lies They Tell about Me Aren't True
Description: Implement a function puts2 that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

Task 7: Winning Is Only Half of It. Having Fun Is the Other Half
Description: Write a function puts_half that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. If the string's length is odd, it should print the last n characters, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2.

Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);

Task 8: Arrays Are Not Pointers
Description: Create a function print_array that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. The numbers should be separated by a comma and a space.

Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);

Task 9: strcpy
Description: Write a function _strcpy that copies a string (including the terminating null byte) from src to dest.

Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

Task 10: Great Leaders Are Willing to Sacrifice the Numbers to Save the People. Poor Leaders Sacrifice the People to Save the Numbers
Description: Implement a function _atoi that converts a string to an integer, taking into account signs (+/-) and ignoring non-numeric characters. If no valid integer is found, return 0.

Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);

Task 11: Don't Hate the Hacker, Hate the Code
Description: Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme. You are allowed to use the standard library and should follow specific rules to generate valid passwords.
