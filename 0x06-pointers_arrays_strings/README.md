Low-Level Programming and Algorithms
Welcome to the "Low-Level Programming and Algorithms" project! Within this repository, you will discover a series of C programming challenges designed to enhance your proficiency in working with pointers, strings, and various algorithms. Each task has been meticulously crafted to focus on a distinct concept, demanding your expertise to devise functions or programs that successfully fulfill the specified objectives.

Task 0: 98 Battery St.
Description: Craft a function named reset_to_98 that takes a pointer to an integer as its parameter. This function should alter the value to which the pointer points, resetting it to 98.

Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

Task 1: Don't Swap Horses in Crossing a Stream
Description: Develop the function swap_int which is responsible for interchanging the values of two integers.

Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

Task 2: This Report, by Its Very Length, Defends Itself against the Risk of Being Read
Description: Formulate a function _strlen that returns the length of a given string.

Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

Task 3: I Do Not Fear Computers. I Fear the Lack of Them
Description: Construct the function _puts to showcase your ability to print a string to the standard output, followed by a newline character.

Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

Task 4: I Can Only Go One Way. I've Not Got a Reverse Gear
Description: Create the function print_rev to display a string in reverse order, followed by a newline character.

Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

Task 5: A Good Engineer Thinks in Reverse and Asks Himself about the Stylistic Consequences of the Components and Systems He Proposes
Description: Engineer the function rev_string which effectively reverses a given string.

Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

Task 6: Half the Lies They Tell about Me Aren't True
Description: Implement the function puts2 that selectively prints every other character of a string, beginning with the first character and ending with a newline character.

Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

Task 7: Winning Is Only Half of It. Having Fun Is the Other Half
Description: Construct the function puts_half that prints the second half of a string, followed by a newline character. If the string's length is odd, it should print the last n characters, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2.

Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);

Task 8: Arrays Are Not Pointers
Description: Develop the function print_array with the purpose of printing n elements of an integer array, followed by a newline character. The numbers should be separated by a comma and a space.

Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);

Task 9: strcpy
Description: Construct the function _strcpy to copy a string (including the null terminator) from source to destination.

Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

Task 10: Great Leaders Are Willing to Sacrifice the Numbers to Save the People. Poor Leaders Sacrifice the People to Save the Numbers
Description: Engineer the function _atoi to convert a given string to an integer, taking into consideration signs (+/-) and disregarding non-numeric characters. If no valid integer is present, return 0.

Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);

Task 11: Don't Hate the Hacker, Hate the Code
Description: Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme. You are permitted to use the standard library and are required to adhere to specific rules in order to produce valid passwords.
