C Programming Challenges Repository: 0x09-static_libraries
Welcome to the C Programming Challenges Repository! This repository contains a series of programming exercises aimed at enhancing your skills in working with static libraries in the C programming language. Each challenge focuses on specific aspects of creating and using static libraries, enabling you to build a deeper understanding of this fundamental concept.

Task 0: A Library Is Not a Luxury but One of the Necessities of Life
Description: Create a static library named libmy.a that includes the following functions:

_putchar
_islower
_isalpha
_abs
_isupper
_isdigit
_strlen
_puts
_strcpy
_atoi
_strcat
_strncat
_strncpy
_strcmp
_memset
_memcpy
_strchr
_strspn
_strpbrk
_strstr
If you haven't implemented all of the above functions, create empty ones with the correct prototypes. Don't forget to push your main.h file to the repository, which should contain all the prototypes of the listed functions.

Task 1: Without Libraries, What Have We?
Description: Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that generates a static library named liball.a from all the .c files in the current directory.
