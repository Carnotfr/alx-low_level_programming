Project Overview
This project, titled "Preprocessor" in the curriculum, consists of multiple tasks that involve working with C preprocessor directives and macros. Here's a brief description of each task:

Task 0: Object-like Macro
In this task, you are required to create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

Task 1: Pi
For this task, you need to create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

Task 2: File name
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library for this task.

Task 3: Function-like macro
In this task, you are tasked with creating a function-like macro named ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

Task 4: SUM
For this task, you need to create a function-like macro named SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.

Each task comes with example programs that demonstrate the usage of the macros you define. These tasks are designed to help you become more familiar with preprocessor directives and macros in C.

The project aims to strengthen your understanding of how macros work and how they can be useful in simplifying code and improving code readability.
