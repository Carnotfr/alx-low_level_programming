Project Overview: Structures and Typedef
This project focuses on working with structures and typedefs in the C programming language. Below are the tasks completed in this project along with their descriptions:

Task 0: Poppy
Define a new structure named struct dog with the following members:

name, type char *
age, type float
owner, type char *
Write a program that initializes an instance of struct dog, assigns values to its members, and prints the information.

Task 1: A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself
Write a function named init_dog that initializes a struct dog with given values for its members name, age, and owner.

Task 2: A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad
Write a function named print_dog that prints the information of a struct dog. If a member is NULL, it should print (nil) instead.

Task 3: Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read
Define a new type dog_t as a typedef for the struct dog type.

Task 4: A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of
Write a function named new_dog that creates a new instance of struct dog, allocates memory for name and owner, and copies the provided values into the new structure.

Task 5: How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg
Write a function named free_dog that frees the memory allocated for an instance of struct dog, including its name and owner members.

Each task in this project builds upon the previous one and covers different aspects of working with structures and typedefs in C.
